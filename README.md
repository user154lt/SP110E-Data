<h1>SP110E-Data</h1>

This repo contains the data required to control SP110E lights, for all commands except color there are some seemingly random 
bytes I have inserted the byte 0x9A but I am pretty sure you could substitute this for any value of your choosing.

You will find the service and characteristic UUIDs in the [SP110EDataProvider](SP110EDataProvider.kt) class.
